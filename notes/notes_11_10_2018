1.I analysed the ChampSt1 metatranscriptomics samples and made a barplot (sequences blasted with Diamond against refseq protein dataset).
2.I see a nice rise and fall of hte Dolichospermum cyanobacteri.
3.But 3 samples are weird (replicates of one time point) because they are composed essentially of Inediibacterium. 
4.When I google this bacteria, it turns out to be from human fecal species. 
5.To a lesser extent the Blautia, Streptococcus and Virgibacillus are very weird too (human fecal)
6.If I look at the Inediibacterium, there essentially all blast to the same protein. 
6b.Also this protein in not available on NCBI anymore...
7.If I look at these sequences and blast them to an NCBI nr nucleotide database, they blast to Nostoc spp., a cyanobacteria
8.But if I blast 100k sequences from these weird 20160915 samples, against the Inediibacterium genome, a get a lot of hits but all at the same place
9.If I blast another sample against Inediibacterium, I get 200 times fewer hits.
10. So in conclusion, there is ONE weird sequence in the 20160915, but it is very very abundant.
10b. I don't really know what this sequence is....
